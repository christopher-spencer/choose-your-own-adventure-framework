    //todo What do we need for Tic Tac Toe:

    //player wins vs postman wins boolean (could add to Game class)

    //need to build an actual menu "GUI" graph showing xs and os on board

    //Think about how to keep track of where those xs and os are
    //Probably a counter, if 3 you win---> counter only goes up based on three in row on board
